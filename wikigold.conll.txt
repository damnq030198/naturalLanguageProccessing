so O

The O
origin O
of O
Agotes I-MISC

uncertain O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
they O
were O
descendants O
of O
the O
Visigoths I-MISC

and O
somebody O
derives O
the O
name O
from O
caas O
( O
dog O
) O
and O
Goth I-MISC

But O
opposed O
to O
this O
etymology O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
word O
" O
cagot O

is O
first O
found O
in O
this O
form O
no O
earlier O
than O
1551 O

Marca I-PER
( O
16th O

, O
in O
his O
Histoire I-MISC
de I-MISC
Beam I-MISC
, O
holds O
that O
the O
word O
signifies O
hunters O
of O
the O
Goths I-MISC
, O
and O
that O
the O
Cagots I-MISC
are O
descendants O
of O
the O
Saracens I-MISC

Others O
made O
them O
descendants O
of O
the O
Albigenses I-MISC

A O
far O
more O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O
Christians I-MISC
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
medieval O
times O
all O
lepers O
were O
known O
as O
pauperes O
Christi O

and O
that O
, O
Goths I-MISC

these O

the O
Middle O

with O
a O
particular O
form O

Thus O
would O

the O

It O

the O

system O

where O
a O

face O
a O

each O
week O
for O
the O
championship O
, O
and O
the O
series O
system O
, O
which O
corresponds O
to O
the O
regular O
season O
found O
in O
the O
NHL I-ORG
today O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
1888 O
, O
the O
challenge O
system O
was O
exclusively O
used O
in O
the O
AHAC I-ORG
before O
the O
advent O
of O
the O
Stanley I-MISC
Cup I-MISC
, O
while O
the O
series O
system O
became O
the O
norm O
in O
1893 O
, O
the O
first O
year O
the O
Cup I-MISC
was O
contested O
. O

The O
first O
championship O
team O
of O
the O
AHAC I-ORG

the O
Montreal I-ORG

having O
unofficially O
being O
declared O
the O
champions O
before O
the O
AHAC I-ORG

The O
first O
title O

, O
1887 O
, O
when O
the O
Montreal I-ORG
Victorias I-ORG
defeated O
the O
champions O
4-0 O
. O

The O
Victorias I-ORG
would O
hold O
the O
title O
until O
the O
very O
last O
challenge O
game O
, O
when O
the O
Crystals I-ORG
won O
3-2 O
in O
their O
third O
successive O
challenge O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
Vics I-ORG
' O
long O
run O
as O
champions O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
switch O
to O
the O
series O
system O
in O
1888 O
. O

The O
series O
system O
was O
a O
success O
, O

a O
tie O
atop O
the O

between O
the O
Vics I-ORG

the O
Montreal I-ORG
Hockey I-ORG
Club I-ORG
( O
Montreal I-ORG

, O
and O
the O
subsequent O
scheduling O
of O
the O
tiebreaker O
game O
caused O
much O
trouble O
when O
the O
game O
was O
scheduled O
at O

time O

were O
injured O
, O
at O
the O
home O

the O
Montreal I-ORG

However O
, O
teams O
from O

incurred O
huge O
travelling O
expenses O
, O
which O
led O
the O
AHAC I-ORG
to O
revert O
back O
to O
the O
challenge O
system O
. O

In O
1893 O
, O
the O
first O
year O
since O

played O
under O

for O

15 O

parent O

the O
Montreal I-ORG
Amateur I-ORG
Athletic I-ORG
Association I-ORG
( O
MAAA I-ORG

. O

The O
hockey O
club O
was O
adamant O
about O
refusing O
the O
trophy O
, O
while O
the O
directors O
of O
the O
MAAA I-ORG
decided O
to O
accept O
the O
trophy O
, O
considering O
it O
came O
from O
the O
Governor O
General O
of O
Canada I-LOC
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
trophy O
was O
accepted O
by O
the O
MAAA I-ORG
, O
but O
with O
none O
of O
the O
hockey O
officials O
of O
the O
hockey O
club O
present O
. O

After O
accepting O
the O
trophy O
, O
the O
hockey O
club O
remained O
adamant O
about O
returning O
the O
trophy O
that O
was O
presented O
to O
them O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
the O
MAAA I-ORG
investigated O
into O
why O
its O
hockey O
club O
wanted O
to O
refuse O
and O
return O
the O
trophy O
, O
even O
though O
such O
an O
action O
would O
damage O
the O
reputation O
of O
the O
MAAA I-ORG
. O

It O
was O
believed O
that O
the O
people O
who O
were O
in O
charge O
of O
running O
their O
team O
were O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
not O
representative O
of O
the O
team O
itself O
, O
and O
when O
the O
hockey O
club O
asked O
for O
a O
loan O
of O
$175 O
in O
start-up O
expenses O
for O
the O
1894 O
season O
, O
it O
was O
flatly O
refused O
( O
the O
first O
time O
the O
MAAA I-ORG
refused O
anything O
to O
the O
hockey O
club O
) O
. O

Inexplicably O
, O
the O
hockey O
club O
reversed O
its O
position O
, O
and O
the O
next O
few O
months O
saw O
a O
gradual O
schism O
between O
the O
MAAA I-ORG
and O
the O
club O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O
inscriptions O
on O
the O
Cup I-MISC
when O
it O
was O
successfully O
defended O
in O
1894 O
only O
stated O
" O
Montreal I-ORG

" O
. O

The O
MAAA I-ORG
, O
at O
one O
point O
, O
considered O
the O
hockey O
club O
to O
have O
seceded O
from O
the O
organization O
that O
bore O
them O
. O

The O
issue O
would O
be O
finally O
resolved O
in O
later O
years O
, O
after O
various O
attempts O
at O
reconciliation O

, O
in O
1987 O
, O
was O
forced O
to O
undergo O
a O
life-threatening O
Caesarean O

in O
an O
unsuccessful O
attempt O

case O
law O
establishing O
the O
rights O
of O
pregnant O
women O
to O
determine O
their O
own O
health O
care O
. O

At O
age O
thirteen O
, O
Angela I-PER
Stoner I-PER
was O
diagnosed O
with O
a O
rare O
and O
usually O
fatal O
form O
of O
cancer O
. O

She O
survived O
, O
and O
after O
years O
of O
chemotherapy O
and O
radiation O
therapy O
was O
declared O
to O
be O
in O
remission O
. O

Ten O
years O
after O
the O
initial O
diagnosis O
she O
developed O
another O
form O
of O
cancer O
, O
which O
she O
and O
her O
doctors O
fought O
with O
equal O
determination O
. O

The O
second O
cancer O
went O
into O
remission O
. O

Angela I-PER
later O
married O
and O
became O
pregnant O
. O

In O
1987 O
, O
when O
Carder I-PER
was O
twenty-five O
weeks O
pregnant O
, O
her O
cancer O
was O
discovered O
to O
have O
recurred O
and O
metastasized O
to O
her O
lung O
. O

Exactly O
what O
plan O
she O
made O
on O
learning O
this O
is O
unclear O
: O
one O
source O
claims O
that O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
prolong O
her O
life O
, O
and O
elected O
to O
start O
radiation O
and O
chemotherapy O
, O
regardless O
of O
known O
risks O
to O
the O
fetus O
; O
others O
state O
that O
she O
chose O
to O
institute O
only O
palliative O
care O
, O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
remain O
alive O
until O
the O
28th O
week O
of O
gestation O
, O
when O
it O
was O
thought O
the O
fetus O
would O
have O
a O
better O
chance O
of O
survival O
. O

Whatever O
her O
choice O
, O
the O
administrators O
of O
George I-ORG
Washington I-ORG
University I-ORG
Hospital I-ORG
-- O
who O
were O
also O
the O
liability O
risk O
managers O
-- O
were O
disturbed O
to O
hear O
that O
she O
had O
not O
elected O
to O
have O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
procedure O
. O

Fearing O
a O
lawsuit O
by O
pro-life O
activists O
, O
they O
convened O
a O
court O
hearing O
at O
the O
hospital O
and O
obtained O
separate O
counsels O
for O
Carder I-PER
, O
her O
fetus O
, O
and O
the O
hospital O
. O

At O
the O
hearing O
, O
family O
members O
, O
including O
Carder I-PER
's O
husband O
, O
opposed O
the O
C-section O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
she O
would O
be O
unlikely O
to O
survive O
it O
and O
that O
she O
would O
not O
want O
it O
( O
Carder I-PER
herself O
, O
now O
gravely O
ill O
, O
did O
not O
testify O
) O
. O

Her O
treating O
physicians O
also O
opposed O
the O
procedure O
. O

However O
, O
a O
neonatologist O
not O
personally O
familiar O
with O
her O
medical O
status O
testified O
that O
the O
fetus O
would O
have O
at O
least O
a O
60% O
chance O
of O
survival O
-- O
nearly O
that O
of O
a O
healthy O
woman O
's O
fetus O
at O
the O
same O
gestational O
age O
. O

Carder I-PER
's O
own O
long-term O
oncologist O
was O
not O
contacted O
; O
he O
has O
since O
stated O
that O
he O
would O
have O
called O
the O
procedure O
" O
medically O
inadvisable O
both O
for O
Angela I-PER
Carder I-PER
and O
for O
the O
fetus O
" O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
and O
despite O
medical O
testimony O
that O
such O
a O
procedure O
would O
probably O
end O
Carder I-PER
's O
life O
, O
an O
order O
was O
issued O
authorizing O
the O
hospital O
to O
perform O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
. O

Obstetricians O
at O
the O
hospital O
initially O
refused O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
procedure O
, O
but O
eventually O
one O
reluctantly O
agreed O
. O

A O
three-judge O
appellate O
panel O
upheld O
the O
decision O
in O
an O
emergency O
telephone O
appeal O
, O
despite O
Carder I-PER
's O
own O
repeated O
pleas O
of O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
done O
. O
" O

Exactly O
how O
long O
the O
fetus O
survived O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
some O
dispute O
. O

The O
most O
commonly O
cited O
figure O
is O
two O
hours O
. O

Susan I-PER
Faludi I-PER
quotes O
the O
obstetrician O
who O
performed O
the O
surgery O
as O
saying O
attempts O
to O
inflate O
the O
fetus O
's O
lungs O
were O
" O
like O
trying O
to O
ventilate O
a O

" O
